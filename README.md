=========================

A very opinionated AngularJS decorator and provider inspired by the [web components proposal](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) to simplify use of directives as reusable components.

See [demo](http://kennethlynne.github.io/angular-component/), and view source.

## Usage
To install: `bower install angular-component`
Add a reference to the script after angular, but before you use the component helper.

###Example:
```javascript
var demo = angular.module('DemoApp', []);

demo.component('unicornTest', function ($log) {
    $log.log('Demo component says hi!')

    return {
        link: function (scope) {
            scope.message = "I'm a unicorn component!";
        }
    }
});
```

views/components/unicorn-test/unicorn-test.html:
```
<p>{{message}}</p>
```

```
<unicorn-test-component></unicorn-test-component>
```

Will now expand into a directive that by convention loads a template from ```/views/components/unicorn-test/unicorn-test.html```, replaces contents by default, and creates a new scope.
The object that the constructor returns should be a directive definition object. This will then be decorated for convention over configuration.

One way you might use it:

```javascript
demo.component('horsePartial');
```

This will try to fetch a template from `/views/components/horse-partial/horse-partial.html` and instantiate a directive with a isolate scope.
Later on when you want to add some logic, just implement the factory function as you usually do for a directive.

## Configuration
If you want to set the view path you may do something like this
```javascript
demo.config(function (componentFactoryProvider) {
    componentFactoryProvider.setViewPath('some/custom/path/');
});
```
Views will then be loaded from
`some/custom/path/unicorn-test/unicorn-test.html`

You can also provide `setViewPath` with a factory function to do more custom handling based on the components name:

```javascript
componentFactoryProvider.setViewPath(function (componentSnakeCasedName, componentName) {
    return 'components/' + componentSnakeCasedName + '/some-path/views/' + componentName + '.html';
});
```
This function will be called on every registration to map the component name to a url.
The above example will return 'components/example-name/some-path/views/exampleName.html'

The factory will be served with two parameters: the snake cased component name, and the original one, and is expected to return a string path.
